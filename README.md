### [Hydrology/R] Event Peakflow (in construction)
Looking for event peakflow by given threshold to the minimum flow and slopes of changing flow.  It can return event peakflows by either the maximum flow during an event or the first peak during an event.

*Status: finished the basic calculation and workflow, needs to be checked the logic and cleaned up*

### [Hydrology/Arcpy] Extract Zonal Mean
Use python along with ArcGIS to extract zonal mean of variables (e.g. precipitation, air temperature, solar radiation, etc.) for given watersheds from 16-year daily rater data.  

### [Hydrology/R] Salt Injection
Comparing salt injection to flow meter for measuring a mountainous stream flow, the Rmarkdown file can generate the report and the record data from each fieldwork.  Open the Rmarkdown file and input the latest fieldwork data, then knit.

### [Data/R] RRAHFO
Downloading NWS/NOAA rainfall summary data for Hawaii. Written in R script. (Note: need R package RCurl)
